            <p>Ayurveda is a complete system of natural medicine that has been practiced for over 5,000 years. It is based on the balance of the three doshas&mdash;Vata, Pitta, and Kapha&mdash;which govern all physical and mental functions in the body. At Sree Nandanam, treatment begins with understanding each patient&rsquo;s unique body constitution (Prakriti) and current imbalance (Vikriti). This personalized diagnosis ensures that every therapy, medicine, and lifestyle recommendation is specifically tailored for the individual.</p>
            <p>The hospital strictly follows classical Ayurvedic texts while applying them in a practical and modern clinical environment. Only high-quality herbal formulations, traditional oils, and natural ingredients are used. Each medicine is carefully selected based on the patient&rsquo;s age, digestion, disease condition, and overall health, making the treatments both gentle and effective.</p>
            <h3>Expert Medical Team</h3>
            <p>Sree Nandanam Ayurveda Hospital is guided by experienced and qualified Ayurvedic physicians:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Dr. Viji Vikraman, BAMS, MD (AY)</li>
              <li>Dr. Eena D., BAMS, MS (AY)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Both doctors bring deep knowledge of classical Ayurveda along with years of hands-on clinical experience. They take time to listen to patients, understand their health history, and explain treatment plans clearly. Their patient-centered approach builds trust and helps individuals feel confident and supported throughout their healing journey.</p>
